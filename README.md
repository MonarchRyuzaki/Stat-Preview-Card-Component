## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Did Not Really Learn Anything New. It was a good practice for flexbox and positioning things.

### Continued development

I would like to continue improving upon positioning and flexbox. New things to focus will be on tackling images and gradients.
